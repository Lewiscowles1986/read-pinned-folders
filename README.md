# read-pinned-folders

This is proof of concept go code to read the pinned folders from Microsoft Windows systems.

It's really quite annoying that this did not exist, and I've not spent too much time on coding it.

PR's welcome.

Eventually I'd like this code to sit in [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) to help that project with https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/1238

Since coding it, I've been wondering if this might also help with backup / restore & machine provisioning if I can construct a matching file and read it into a sane text format.
